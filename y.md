Thanks for the clear summary ‚Äî you're on the right track, and your field mapping looks mostly correct. I‚Äôll break this into sections:

---

## ‚úÖ First: Cleaned-Up Field Type Table (without `models.`)

Here‚Äôs the version with the `models.` prefix removed, and a minor fix at the end:

---

## ‚úÖ Second: Functional Features You Want

Now let‚Äôs map out how to **implement the features you mentioned**:

---

### üîπ 1. **Employee Can See Total, Pending, Paid & Unpaid Leaves**

‚úÖ You‚Äôll need:

* A `status` field in `LeaveApplications` (which you already have)
* Possibly a new field like `is_paid` (BooleanField) in `LeaveApplications`

üõ† Suggested queries:

* **Total leaves:** `LeaveApplications.objects.filter(EmployeeId=emp)`
* **Pending leaves:** `...filter(Status="Pending")`
* **Paid leaves:** `...filter(is_paid=True)`
* **Unpaid leaves:** `...filter(is_paid=False)`

---

### üîπ 2. **Payroll**

‚úÖ Already handled by `Salaries` table.

üìä In dashboard:

* Show salary breakdown per employee
* Show department-wise salary total using Django `annotate()` and `Sum()`

---

### üîπ 3. **Dashboard**

You can build a dashboard with:

* **Department-wise salary:**

```python
Department.objects.annotate(total_salary=Sum('employees__salaries__NetSalary'))
```

* **Leave overview:**

```python
LeaveApplications.objects.values('Status').annotate(count=Count('id'))
```

* **Manager display:** see below ‚¨áÔ∏è

---

### üîπ 4. **Show Manager of Each Employee**

To assign a **Manager per Department**, add a field to `Departments`:

```python
Manager = models.ForeignKey('Employees', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='managed_departments')
```

Then, for each `Employee`, you can find their manager via:

```python
employee.DepartmentId.Manager
```

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Payroll per employee      | Salaries model + per-user view                                            |
| Department salary summary | Aggregate via Django ORM using `annotate` and `Sum`                       |
| Manager view              | `Manager` field in Departments, then access via Employee‚Äôs Department     |
| Leave balance tracking    | Use `LeaveBalances`, updated when leave is approved                       |
| Paid/unpaid leaves        | Add `is_paid = models.BooleanField(default=False)` in `LeaveApplications` |

## üöÄ Want Next Steps?

I can help you:

* Generate **Django model classes** from these tables
* Create **views or serializers** for these dashboards
* Build the **dashboard using Django admin or DRF + React/Template**

Would you like the Django models next or the dashboard logic?

--------------------------------------------------------------

To let an **employee see their manager**, you need both **data relationships** in your Django models and a **view or page** where the employee can access this info. Here's exactly **how and where** to do this in your Django project:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Model Setup: Who is the Manager?**

In your **Departments** model, add a `Manager` field:

```python
# departments/models.py

from django.db import models
from employees.models import Employee  # Adjust path as per your structure

class Department(models.Model):
    DepartmentId = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    DepartmentName = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    Description = models.CharField(max_length=500, blank=True, null=True)
    
    # üü¢ This is the key field
    Manager = models.ForeignKey(
        'employees.Employee',
        null=True,
        blank=True,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        related_name='manages_department'
    )

    CreatedDate = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    ModifiedDate = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    CreatedBy = models.ForeignKey('employees.Employee', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='dept_created_by')
    ModifiedBy = models.ForeignKey('employees.Employee', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='dept_modified_by')
```

Now every department has a single manager, who is an employee.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **How to Access This Info in Code**

Once this relationship is set, you can access an employee‚Äôs manager like this:

```python
employee = request.user.employee  # Assuming logged-in user is linked to Employee model
manager = employee.DepartmentId.Manager
```

You can display their **name, email, phone**, etc.:

```python
if manager:
    print(f"Manager: {manager.FirstName} {manager.LastName} ({manager.Email})")
else:
    print("No manager assigned to your department.")
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Where to Show the Manager in the UI**

Here are some common places you can show the manager:

### üîπ a. **Employee Dashboard Page**

Create a simple dashboard view:

```python
# employees/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Employee

def employee_dashboard(request):
    employee = request.user.employee
    manager = employee.DepartmentId.Manager if employee.DepartmentId else None

    return render(request, 'employee/dashboard.html', {
        'employee': employee,
        'manager': manager
    })
```

### üîπ b. **Dashboard Template**

```html
<!-- templates/employee/dashboard.html -->

<h2>Welcome {{ employee.FirstName }}</h2>

{% if manager %}
    <h3>Your Manager:</h3>
    <p>{{ manager.FirstName }} {{ manager.LastName }}</p>
    <p>Email: {{ manager.Email }}</p>
{% else %}
    <p>No manager assigned to your department yet.</p>
{% endif %}
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Django Admin (Optional)**

In `admin.py`, you can also show manager info in the Department list:

```python
class DepartmentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('DepartmentName', 'Manager')

admin.site.register(Department, DepartmentAdmin)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Ensure Authentication**

Make sure your `Employee` model is linked to the Django `User` model so each logged-in user can see their personal info.

Example:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Employee(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # other fields...
```

## üß† Summary: How Employees See Their Manager

| Step | What to Do                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Add `Manager = ForeignKey(Employee)` in `Departments`       |
| 2    | Assign managers to each department in admin panel or script |
| 3    | Access manager with `employee.DepartmentId.Manager`         |
| 4    | Display this in a view like `dashboard.html`                |
| 5    | Ensure authentication links each `User` to an `Employee`    |
